# SafeAnonymousChat

## Goal

To create a safe environment for children to connect to other children,
knowing they are indeed other children and not catfishes. Communication
should be secured so they can talk to others in such a manner they are
sure no parents are listening in.

## Requirements
- All communication is end-to-end encrypted using private key of sender
  and public key of receiver
- From the database there is no way to determine who is who and who is
  talking to whom
- Everyone trying to create an account on the system, will be checked if
  sex/age is truthfully, and a hash of the national number is stored
  with the account (to track abuse)
-
